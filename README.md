## About

Hi! I'm a graduate student at University of Florida pursuing my PhD in Mechanical Enginering. To be specific, my domain of research is computational fluid dynamics (_CFD_). I use computer code to solve complex mathematical equations that govern the physics of fluid flows in an attempt to understand the underlying phenomenon.   
When I'm not busy working or cursing at my computer screen, I like to travel, go hiking, especially the west coast of USA and take photographs.

## Research

My research involves developing _LES_ and force models for compressible multiphase flows in Euler-Lagrange framework. I'm interested in understanding the underlying physics of multiphase fluids under extreme environments as such during volcanic eruptions.   
Furthermore, I'm interested in higher-order numerical methods for highly compressible flows, dynamics of turbulence in compressible regimes and high performance computing.

## Projects

_Work in progress_...    
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/konerr/konerr.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/konerr/konerr.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
