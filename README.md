## About
<p align="justify">
Hi! I'm a graduate student at University of Florida pursuing my PhD in Mechanical Enginering. To be specific, my domain of research is computational fluid dynamics (<i>CFD</i>). I use computer code to solve complex mathematical equations that govern the physics of fluid flows in an attempt to understand the underlying phenomenon.<br> 
When I'm not busy working or cursing at my computer screen, I like to travel, go hiking, especially the west coast of USA and take photographs.  
</p>

## Research
<p align="justify">
My research involves developing <i>LES</i> and force models for compressible multiphase flows in Euler-Lagrange framework. I'm interested in understanding the underlying physics of multiphase fluids under extreme environments as such during volcanic eruptions.<br>
Furthermore, I'm interested in higher-order numerical methods for highly compressible flows, dynamics of turbulence in compressible regimes and high performance computing.

## Projects

_Work in progress_...    
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/konerr/konerr.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/konerr/konerr.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
